# __Henna Styles__

The past year of worldwide lockdowns has inspired many people to take up new hobbies and attempt beauty treatments at home,
 as they could no longer visit professionals. Henna Styles is an online henna shop and art community, which provides a range 
 of henna products visitors can purchase as well as providing a platform for people interested in henna design to improve their
 abilities and learn from each other.

## __UX__

### __Value provided:__
#### __For users:__
- As a visitor with no previous experience with henna I would like to know more about it before purchasing.
    - The homepage will address this as soon as a visitor lands on the site. The homepage will contain a link to the community 
    section and shop so visitors can find further information or go straight to the shop. 
- As a new user I want guidance on how to use the products effectively
    - The community section will address this. People will be able to view henna related posts from other users and the site 
    owner. Knowing more will encourage them to make purchases and experiment with extra products. In order to ask questions of 
    the community however they will have to create an account.
- As a professional user and want to find a range of products in one place
    - The homepage will contain a link to the shop and the types of different products will be displayed on the navigation bar 
    throughout the site so visitors can find what they are looking for quickly from anywhere.
- As a user who has some previous interest in henna I want to know what I have purchased before so I can repurchase easily
    - When making a purchase customers can create an account which will hold their preferred shipping details and an order history. This will be available only by logging in when making a purchase.
- As a professional user I want to see others work for inspiration
    - Community page will allow people to view others' work, however to gain the full effect of the community (respond to 
    and create posts), users will have to log in.
#### __For store owner:__ I want to maximise sales.
- I want to make sure all visitors know the range of products being sold.
    - Site navigation will contain the main types of products sold and will be available throughout the site.
- I want the user to have a positive response to the site and spend longer on it as this will motivate return visits.
    - Users will be able to view the community page which will produce a positive response and lead them to stay on the site longer. They will be made aware that they must create an account to access all actions on the page.
- I want to increase the number of visitors who return to the site in order to gain repeat purchases.
    - The community page and order history increase the likelihood customers will return, either to view new posts, 
    comments on posts that interested them or simply repurchase a product they liked.

### __Wireframes__
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the 
design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory),
 or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

### __Overall design__
+ In order to get an idea of the conventions of shopping/blog art sites I visited several online stores. The styling is simple
 when displaying products but other pages are loaded with colour and images, creating a positive response. Several of the more popular art 
 supply shops had sections which contained information and blog posts (like jackson art). I also viewed some online henna shops 
 which appeared to be for smaller companies as the style was very simplistic and none offered all the different types of products 
 offered on Henna Styles. Some of the sites used for inspiration include: [Jackson art](https://www.jacksonsart.com/),
 [Desenio](https://desenio.co.uk/), [Henna Shop](https://www.hennashop.co.uk/).

+ The colour scheme used for the site was created with coloors. The colours are simple including black, gray and shades of pink,
this was chosen in order to keep the pages simple while still vibrant and allow image pages to create a strong response in 
comparison. [Palette used](https://coolors.co/ffb6c1-d6d7d7-b27f87-210124-00171f).
